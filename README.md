# JudeBalance

JudeBalance is a mobile application designed to help prevent falls in older adults by
measuring balance using smartphone sensors and providing personalised exercise recommendations.

The app guides users through a short balance test, analyses stability, and recommends
appropriate exercises based on individual balance performance.

**Data Flow Overview**
1. The mobile app collects balance data using device sensors.
2. Balance scores and user profile data are sent to the AI recommendation server.
3. The recommendation server processes the data and returns personalised exercise suggestions.
4. Measurement results and recommendations are stored via the backend server.

## My Contribution

- Designed and implemented the balance measurement logic, including score calculation and data flow for stability assessment
- Developed the mobile frontend using React Native, implementing balance measurement, result visualisation, and recommendation UI
- Defined API specifications, data structures, and response formats
- Conducted end-to-end testing across the mobile app, AI server, and backend, identifying and resolving integration issues

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Handling incomplete or early-terminated balance measurements
**Solution:**  
Users occasionally failed to maintain balance for the full measurement duration or manually stopped the test midway. Treating these cases as zero scores resulted in misleading outcomes and poor user experience.
To address this, a duration-aware scoring strategy was designed, where the final balance score is proportionally adjusted based on the actual time the user maintained the posture. This approach preserves result fairness while still reflecting reduced stability when measurements are interrupted.

### Challenge 2: Managing complex recommendation logic without overloading the frontend
**Solution:**  
Separated the exercise recommendation logic into a dedicated FastAPI server, keeping the frontend
lightweight and improving modularity.

## Results

- Completed an end-to-end balance measurement and exercise recommendation flow
- Improved system modularity by separating AI logic into a standalone server
- Enabled personalised exercise recommendations tailored to individual balance performance
- Achieved smooth collaboration through clearly defined API contracts

## What I Learned

- Designing and implementing APIs in a multi-server architecture
- Translating sensor data into user-facing features
- Collaborating effectively across frontend, AI, and backend roles
- Structuring a project for maintainability and future expansion
